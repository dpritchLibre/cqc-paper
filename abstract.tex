Accurate classification of high-dimensional data is important in many scientific
applications.  We propose a family of high-dimensional classification methods
based upon a comparison of the component-wise distances of the feature vector of
a sample to the within-class population quantiles.  These methods are motivated
by the fact that quantile classifiers based on these component-wise distances
are the most powerful univariate classifiers for an optimal choice of the
quantile level.  A simple aggregation approach for constructing a multivariate
classifier based upon these component-wise distances to the within-class
quantiles is proposed.  It is shown that this classifier is consistent with the
asymptotically optimal classifier as the sample size increases.  The form of the
classifier results in a simple piecewise-linear decision rule boundary that can
be efficiently trained.  Numerical results are shown to demonstrate competitive
performance for the proposed classifiers on both simulated data and a benchmark
email spam application.
