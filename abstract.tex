Accurate classification of high-dimensional samples is important in many
scientific domains.  We propose a family of high-dimensional classification
methods based upon a comparison of the component-wise distances of the
components of an observation to the within-class quantiles.  These methods are
motivated by the fact that quantile classifiers based on these component-wise
distances are the most powerful univariate classifiers for an optimal choice of
quantile level.  A simple aggregation approach for constructing a multivariate
classifier based upon these component-wise distances to the within-class
quantiles is proposed.  It is shown that this classifier is consistent with the
asymptotically optimal classifier as the sample size increases.  The form of the
classifier results in a simple piecewise-linear decision rule boundary that can
be efficiently trained.  Numerical results are shown demonstrating competitive
performance for the classifiers both on simulated data and on a benchmark email
spam application.
