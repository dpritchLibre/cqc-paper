Accurate classification of high-dimensional samples is important in many
scientific domains.  We propose a family of high-dimensional classification
methods based upon a comparison of the component-wise distances of the
components of an observation to the within-class quantiles.  These methods are
motivated by the fact that quantile classifiers based on these component-wise
distances are the most powerful univariate classifiers for an optimal choice of
quantile level.  A simple aggregation approach for constructing a multivariate
classifier based upon these component-wise distances to the within-class
quantiles is presented.  It is shown that this classifier is consistent with the
asymptotically optimal classifier as the sample size increases.  Furthermore, as
the sample size and number of discriminative variables both increase, and under
some additional assumptions, the correct classification rate converges to unity.
Some limitations of the simple aggregation approach are discussed, and a second
approach for aggregating the quantile distances in presented.  Numerical results
are shown demonstrating competitive performance for the classifiers both on
simulated data and on a benchmark email spam application.
